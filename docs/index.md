### GOAL
The goal of this project is to refresh the Gemini V3 in a Voron V0.2 to ‘as shipped’ standard as per 01/09/23, with as few external links as possible. It's not perfect, but should get you up and printing again.

This repo consists of 3 sections:

- [Installation](installation.md) - This section will walk you thought how to refresh/reinstall the Fly Gemini V3 board on your Voron 0
- [Updating](updating.md) - Updating your printer and extensions safely.
- [Extras](extras.md) - Additional tutorials e.g. setting up the ADXL via SPI, camera etc.
